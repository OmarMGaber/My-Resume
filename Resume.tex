		In addition to my technical skills, I have good knowledge of relational databases, computer networks, and version control using Git. I am driven by a strong desire to contribute my skills and expertise to a collaborative team environment. I am dedicated to knowledge sharing and continuous learning from my peers, always seeking opportunities for personal and professional growth.\\

	
 		I am driven to contribute my skills and expertise to a cooperative team. I am eager to share my knowledge and learn from others in the process.  I have a strong passion for problem analysis and solving, and I stay current on updated technologies and innovations. With a solution-oriented attitude, I come to tasks with a 'Get Things Done' outlook. My commitment to achieving results and delivering top-notch outcomes is unwavering.\\

			
		During my education, I helped a lot of students from different levels in course registration and organized the ways of communication of my whole batch. I have also taken on leadership roles in various projects, fostering creativity and introducing innovative ideas to the teams. Moreover, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and expertise to elevate the overall skill set of the team. Furthermore, I have a solid foundation in theoretical computer science subjects, including Theory of Computations, Concepts of Programming Languages, Number Theory, Discrete Structures, Data Structures, and Algorithms.

		 \subsection{{Polynomial Calculator}\textmd{\hfill \normalsize{Java - JavaFX}}}
			\vspace{-3mm}
			A 1st year CS project \hfill \small\textit{May 2023 - In Progress}\\
			Data Structures Course
			\begin{itemize}
				\item{\textbf{Description:} This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in data structures problem-solving by creating a practical tool for manipulating polynomials, The project involves creating a Polynomial Calculator based on the LinkedList data structure. 

					Users will be able to input polynomials and perform operations on them, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and evaluation.
					
					The LinkedList data structure will be used to efficiently store and manipulate polynomial terms. Each term, consisting of a coefficient and an exponent, will be stored as a node in the LinkedList. In this way, polynomials of different degrees can be resized and manipulated easily.
					
					It will handle common errors like division by zero or invalid input by providing a user-friendly interface for inputting polynomial equations, simplifying expressions, and performing arithmetic operations. }

			\vspace{-3mm}
			A 1st year CS project \hfill \small\textit{May 2023 - In Progress}\\
			Advanced Programming Course
			\begin{itemize}
				\item{\textbf{Description: }This project involved creating an interactive whiteboard game using Java and JavaFX. The goal was to develop a platform where multiple users could collaborate and draw together.

Using Java and JavaFX, I will design an intuitive interface that allowed participants to express their creativity through drawing and sketching. The application featured real-time synchronization, ensuring that all users could see each other's drawings in real-time.

In order to enhance the user experience, I implemented tools such as brush styles, color selection, and an eraser.}

		\projectTitle{Turing Machine Simulator}{https://github.com/OmarMGaber/Turing-Machine-Simulator}{Java}
			\vspace{-3mm}
			A 1st year CS project \hfill \small\textit{May 2023 - May 2023}\\
			Theory of Computation Course
			\begin{itemize}													% was created as part of the Theory of Computations project.			
				\item{\textbf{Description: }A simple Turing Machine Simulator, where users can enter the number of states, machine language symbols, transition functions, and the string they want to oper	ate on.

The purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for simulating Turing Machines, which are essential concepts in computer science theory. To gain a deeper understanding of Turing Machines, users can customize machine configurations and input strings in the simulator.

Using the simulator, users can observe the step-by-step execution of the Turing Machine, track state changes, and see how the input string is altered as the machine processes it. and finally gets the final string(tape) after the TM operations. }
